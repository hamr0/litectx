# litectx — Integration Guide

The complete adopter contract: every config option, the full public API, the
scope boundaries, and the sharp edges. The README is the pitch; this is the file
you point an integrating agent at. For the design rationale behind the refusals,
the repo-only PRD (`docs/01-product/litectx-prd.md`) is the authority —
but everything you need to *use* litectx is here.

> **Status (important — read first).** litectx is in **active early build**. This
> document describes the contract **as actually shipped** (slices 0–11: incremental
> indexing, symbol chunking, kind-scoped recall, import edges + spreading, git
> grounding, the `impact` view incl. the slice-5b barrel/alias mitigation, the
> opt-in **embeddings** tier incl. written-kind **KNN union** (paraphrase recall),
> the **write path** — `remember`/`forget` for facts/episodes/direct docs —
> chunk-granular recall, `get(id)` body
> access, and the two consumption surfaces: the **CLI** and the stdio **MCP server**). Where the eventual surface (ACT-R base-level activation
> weighting, persisted `call` edges) is **not yet available**, it is marked
> **🚧 roadmap** — do not wire against it yet. What is documented without that mark works
> today and is covered by tests and the multi-repo benchmark.

## What this is

litectx is a local, searchable **memory across kinds** for AI agents, in one
**SQLite** file. Content enters two ways — **`index()`** reads a repository
(code + markdown) from disk, and **`remember()`** writes knowledge that isn't a
file (facts, episodes, runtime docs/FAQs). Over that one store it serves ranked
**recall** (search, kind-scoped) and **impact** (called-by/calling →
blast-radius + risk bucket). It is an `import`-able library that runs **in your
process** against a file on disk — no daemon, no service, no network, no
telemetry. The views read **one** graph built by a single `index()` pass —
`impact()` is computed on demand and never re-extracts, so a symbol you
surface with `recall()` is the same node `impact()` assesses (pinned by
`test/composing.test.js`). The graph is built to grow further (ACT-R-style
activation signals scored on the recall log) under that same one-graph contract.

**The entry path decides the available kinds:** files via `index()` →
`code`/`doc` (by extension — you cannot index a file *as* a fact; distilling a
doc into facts is your extraction, then `remember`). Direct writes via
`remember()` → `fact`/`episode`/`doc`. `doc` is the one kind both produce.
`index()` is **never mandatory** — a litectx used only as a fact/episode store
(no repo, no `index()` call) is a fully supported mode.

## What litectx is and is not

- **Is:** a lite, local-first, in-process memory over your code, docs, and written
  knowledge (facts/episodes), exposing ranked recall, a called-by/calling impact
  view, and a `remember`/`forget` write path. The graph is the substrate and is
  intended to be public API.
- **Is not:** a language server, a vector database, a hosted service, an agent
  framework, or a token-budget/guardrail layer. It has **no LSP tier — ever**
  (see *What's NOT in litectx*). Curation, thresholds, prompt assembly, and budget
  policy belong to the caller, not here.

| Symbol-level `nodes` substrate (tree-sitter: TS/JS/Python + md sections) | ✅ shipped (slice 2) |
| **Kind-scoped recall** (code-over-md fix: kinds never share a ranking) + code-aware body | ✅ shipped (slice 3) |
| **Import edges** + 1-hop **spreading** recall (BM25 + additive boost, w=0.3) | ✅ shipped (slice 4) |
| **Git activity** metadata per hit (`git: { commits, lastCommit }`; grounding, not scored) | ✅ shipped (slice 4) |
| **impact** view (`impact(symbol)`: called-by/calling → risk bucket + complexity, on-demand) | ✅ shipped (slice 5a + 5b barrel/alias resolution) |
| `calls` edges (symbol blast radius) — computed on demand, not persisted (§7.1) | ✅ shipped (slice 5a; `type='call'` row stays reserved for a future persist optimization) |
| Anti-false-isolation for TS aliases / barrels (§7.2) | ✅ shipped (slice 5b — renamed barrel/path-alias re-exports resolved) |
| `getNode` / `related` graph accessors (R-G1/R-G2: describe a node + walk its `import` edges) | ✅ shipped (v0.9.0; API-only) |
| **Embeddings** (semantic tier) | ✅ shipped (slice 6). **ON by default on the CLI + MCP** (`--no-embeddings` for the BM25-only base); the raw `LiteCtx` lib default stays `embeddings: false` (explicit opt-in). `@huggingface/transformers` is an *optional **peer** dep* (**not** auto-installed — `npm i @huggingface/transformers` to enable; graceful BM25 fallback if absent). Near-essential for memory (paraphrase 0.000→0.574); +~0.2 MRR on natural-language code recall. Per-query ~0.7s first load / ~6ms warm (not the mis-borrowed "15–19s") |
| **Write path** — `remember`/`forget` for `fact`/`episode`/direct `doc`; provenance (`by`); recall audit log; `reviewCandidates` HITL query | ✅ shipped (slice 7) |
| **Stemmed fact/episode recall** (porter — inflection-tolerant; doc/code stay keyword-exact by measurement) | ✅ shipped (slice 7b) |
| **Chunk-granular recall** (`hit.chunk` — the matching function/section inside the file) + `log: false` | ✅ shipped (slice 8) |
| **`get(id)` body access** — fetch any item's full text by id (written memory verbatim, files from disk) | ✅ shipped (slice 9) |
| **`get(path, {startLine, endLine})`** — fetch ONE chunk (code + its docstring), not the whole file; content-hash gated, throws `StalePointerError` on drift | ✅ shipped (v0.29.1) |
| **Index self-heals on upgrade** — the index is stamped with the litectx source that built it; a mismatch forces a re-chunk (file rows only; written memory survives) | ✅ shipped (v0.29.1) |
| **`recall(q, {body:true})`** — inline each hit's content (verbatim memory / localized chunk / whole-file fallback); off by default | ✅ shipped (v0.10.0 — RT-3) |
| **`remember(id, text, {meta})`** — sealed opaque-metadata passthrough; verbatim round-trip via `get`/`recall`, never tokenized/searched/scored | ✅ shipped (v0.10.0 — RT-3) |
| **`liteCtxAsStore(lc)`** — mount litectx as a host `Store` (`{store,search,get,delete}`); drop-in for a substring-scan backend, ranked recall | ✅ shipped (v0.10.0 — RT-3) |
| **`compress(node, {level})`** — rank-tiered render (R-C7): `verbatim` / `signature` (header + doc, body elided) / `drop`; tree-sitter signature extraction, ~82% bytes saved with the doc kept | ✅ shipped (library API only, like `stash`/`peek`) |
| **`await assemble(units, ctx)`** — RT-1 budget-fit a neutral transcript to a token budget: recency-anchored, `pinned`/`atomic` invariants, `dropped[]`-with-handle, cache-stable order; a would-be-dropped `code`/`doc` unit is recovered as its `compress()` signature (COMPRESS tier) | ✅ shipped (FIT + COMPRESS; SELECT POC-killed; async) |
| **`await trim(units, policy)`** — R-C5 transcript-truncation: evict old turns by SIZE (`maxTokens`, delegates to `assemble`) or COUNT (`keepLastN`); returns the `harvest` worklist (dropped units, content intact) for harvest-before-evict | ✅ shipped (thin verb; `pinned`/`atomic`-safe; API-only) |
| **MCP server** (`litectx-mcp` bin — stdio, client-spawned, all public operations) + CLI write parity (`remember`/`forget`/`--embeddings`/`--no-log`) | ✅ shipped (slice 10) |
| **KNN union** — embeddings-tier paraphrase recall for `fact`/`episode` (cosine nominates, not just re-ranks) | ✅ shipped (slice 11 — bench: para 0.000→0.574, exact/morph held) |
| **`recentActivity()`** — "what was I working on": witnessed chunk-edits, recency-windowed, isolated from recall | ✅ shipped (slice 5a — access-log tier, view #3) |
| **`recentMemory()`** — recall's empty-FTS-match recency sibling: newest rows by time, scope-fenced. **Doc axis** (default) + **memory axis** (`kind:'fact'|'episode'`, ordered `occurredAt`/`createdAt`) | ✅ shipped (M3 doc → M4 R3 memory — separate verb so recency never pollutes recall ranking) |
| **`count({scope, kind})`** — per-tenant memory count by kind (`/memory`, `/docs`), tenant-fenced + expiry-aware, additive across axes | ✅ shipped (multis M4 O1) |
| **`cosine` on recall hits** — raw query↔hit semantic similarity surfaced on `fact`/`episode` hits (embeddings tier); the KNN cosine litectx already computes, unblessed (aggregate-separable, no per-query threshold — R-S8) | ✅ shipped (multis M13 — no re-embed to read the semantic score) |
| **`scoped(t).forget({id})`** — tenant-fenced delete-by-key: drop one row / one id's segments for that owner only; foreign id → `0` (structural owner-qualified-key fence; delete-side mirror of the `(scope,id)` upsert) | ✅ shipped (multis M14 — retires the scoped-get-then-blind-delete bridge) |
| **`await enumerate({kind, scope, offset, limit, body})`** — exhaustive, rank-free, scope-fenced paginated walk of one memory kind (`fact`/`episode`): the structural opposite of `recall` (FTS-gated/ranked/capped → misses the tail). For batch "count / all of them" (bareagent RLM `scan`). **API-only**, no embedder | ✅ shipped (bareagent RLM scan — gapless union, rowid-ordered, no recall-log) |
| **`promotionCandidates()`** — episode promotion ladder: hot agent episodes → distil to facts; 30-day rolling window + auto-prune | ✅ shipped (slice 5b — access-log tier, view #4) |
| **Scope model** (`owner`/`session` config) — `fact` owner-scoped, `episode` owner+session; recall filters BM25 + KNN; opt-in, host-threaded identity | ✅ shipped (Isolate §4.4 — gate #1: own-run episodes buried 5/6 BM25, 9/10 emb without it) |
| **Write-gate emitter** (`writeGate`/`writeAudit` config; `toWriteAction`/`WriteAudit`/`WriteDeniedError` exports) — `remember()` emits a gate-able `memory.write` action + checks it before commit; deny blocks the write; `writeAudit` records a JSONL line per write **standalone (gate-independent)**; litectx states source + shape flag, never the content verdict | ✅ shipped (CE-PRD §10.1 — opt-in; POC 13/13 on the real bareguard `Gate`; gate demand-gated, no producer for `memory.inject`; audit usable now without a gate) |
| **contextgraph** (`observe`/`ContextGraph` exports; `trace` config; `PRIMITIVE`/`VERBS_BY_PRIMITIVE` taxonomy) — wrap a `LiteCtx` and every CE verb call is recorded into `ctx.trace`: a pipeline graph (`.json()` + agent-readable `.mermaid()`). The CE-**pipeline** view over the same data — sibling to `codegraph`'s content view (`getNode`/`related`/`impact`) | ✅ shipped (observability primitive; SVG + interactive renders in `examples/contextgraph`; setup in `docs/03-usage/graphs.md`) |
| Base-level **activation** as a recall *re-rank* (edit→search score) | ⊘ dropped (POC-falsified repo-dependent — the edit signal lives in `recentActivity`, never in ranking) |
| **Trust columns** on written-memory hits (`provenance`/`use`/`occurredAt`; surfaced, not scored) | ✅ shipped (slice 5c — access-log tier, view #2) |
| Trust/stability as a recall *tie-breaker* (use/churn/provenance → search order) | ⊘ dropped (POC-falsified — no-ops on exact ties, pollutes on any band, and buries fresh/better matches; trust ships as columns, ranking stays pure relevance — slice 5c) |
| **Claude Code integration** (optional, `integrations/claude/`) — LSP-free pre-edit `impact()` hook + SessionStart index-warmer; generic MCP server documented for any client | ✅ shipped (v0.4.0; opt-in, nothing in the library depends on it) |

## Minimal usage

```js
import { LiteCtx } from "litectx";

const ctx = new LiteCtx({ root: "/path/to/repo" });
await ctx.index();                                    // incremental, git-aware
const hits = await ctx.recall("where do we validate the auth token?", { kind: "code" });
// hits: [{ path, kind, format, score, git }, ...]  (score: higher = more relevant; git: activity, not scored)

// memory that isn't a file (slice 7): facts / episodes / runtime docs
await ctx.remember("fact:auth-uses-jwt", "Auth is JWT, verified in middleware.", { kind: "fact", by: "human" });
const facts = await ctx.recall("jwt auth", { kind: "fact" });
// fact/episode hits also carry provenance/use/occurredAt — surfaced for you to weigh, never scored
// (+ cosine, the raw semantic similarity, when the embeddings tier is on)
ctx.get("fact:auth-uses-jwt")?.text;                  // the body itself (recall returns ranked pointers)
ctx.forget("fact:auth-uses-jwt");                     // by key; or forget({ by: "agent" }) in bulk
ctx.close();
```

`index()`, `recall()`, and `remember()` are **async** (`index` parses with a WASM grammar
runtime; `recall`/`remember` embed when the tier is on). `get()`, `forget()`,
`reviewCandidates()`, `size()`, and `close()` are synchronous.

## All options — `LiteCtxConfig`

Passed to `new LiteCtx(config)`. Only `root` is required.

| Option | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `root` | `string` | — (required) | Repository root to index. Throws if omitted. |
| `include` | `string[]` | `[".ts", ".js", ".mjs", ".cjs", ".py", ".md"]` | File extensions to index. Routing is by **extension only** — content is never sniffed. |
| `pathspecs` | `string[]` | unset | Optional git pathspecs to scope the index, e.g. `["app/**/*.js"]`. Applied via `git ls-files`. |
| `dbPath` | `string` | `<root>/.litectx/index.db` | SQLite file path. Use `":memory:"` for an ephemeral in-process index (the parent dir is created for file paths). |
| `embeddings` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable the opt-in **semantic tier**: `index()` embeds each file, `remember()` embeds the text, `recall()` fuses cosine into the ranking — and for `fact`/`episode` also *nominates* the nearest stored vectors into the pool (KNN union: paraphrase recall). Requires the optional peer dep `@huggingface/transformers` (`npm i @huggingface/transformers`). Off → the deterministic BM25 + spreading core, no model loaded. |
| `embedWeight` | `number` | `1.0` | Semantic fusion weight (higher = more semantic). POC-tuned default; held-out-validated, no overfitting cliff. |
| `embedModel` | `string` | `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | transformers.js model id for the tier. |
| `embedder` | `{ embed(text): Promise<Float32Array> }` | built-in | Advanced/testing — inject a custom embedding provider, bypassing the built-in model loading. |
| `owner` | `string` | unset (`null` = global) | **Scope key — the actor.** Scopes durable `fact`s (and tags `episode`s) to an actor in a shared store. Unset = unscoped: `recall` is owner-blind (sees & writes everything). Set it (a multi-tenant / shared-db host resolves it host-side — git email, OS user) and `recall` returns **own + global** facts only, never another actor's. This binds the owner **once on the instance** (one actor per `LiteCtx`); to fence many tenants from **one shared instance**, leave `owner` unset and pass a per-call `scope` (or bind `ctx.scoped(tenant)`) on `recall`/`remember`/`reviewCandidates`/`promotionCandidates` — `scope` → the per-call `mem_scope.owner` (multis M4). `code`/`doc` are never owner-scoped. |
| `session` | `string` | unset (`null` = durable) | **Scope key — the run.** Scopes volatile `episode`s to one run. Unset = unscoped: `recall` sees all sessions' episodes. Set it (a host running concurrent agents threads a run id) and a run's own episodes aren't **buried by more-relevant other sessions** (the measured failure — recency is not a ranking term). `fact`s ignore it (always cross-session). |
| `episodeWindowDays` | `number` | `30` | **Episode retention window (days).** The rolling window an `episode` stays both **retained** and **promote-eligible**: on each episode write, episodes older than this self-prune (anything that mattered was already distilled into a durable `fact`, which never prunes), and the same window floors `promotionCandidates`. One knob bounds the agent scratchpad — no count cap. ⚠ **Not a free hygiene dial — it is coupled to the promotion ladder:** a window shorter than an episode's promote-and-prove time can prune it (and drop it below the promotion floor) *before* it reaches the threshold, so it never promotes. Shorten for data-minimization, lengthen to retain older episodes longer (the set grows); `30` is the safe default that leaves room to promote-and-prove. Rejected at construction if not a positive finite number. `fact`s are durable and unaffected. |
| `strictScope` | `boolean` | `false` | **Fail-closed multi-tenant mode for the per-upload axes.** Off (default) = legacy: a missing/`null` `scope` means "see everything" (right for single-tenant, a footgun on a shared store). On = a missing scope on `recall` (`doc` **or** `fact`/`episode`), `get`, `ingest`, `remember`, `forget`, `reviewCandidates`, or `promotionCandidates` **throws** instead of returning/writing/deleting every tenant's rows. The only ways to act become an explicit tenant `scope` (`scope ∪ global`) or **`GLOBAL`** (the shared tier). Covers the **doc/blob axis** (per-upload `scope`) **and the memory axis** (`fact`/`episode`, where `scope` → the per-call `mem_scope.owner`; multis M4) — only `code` (repo-global) is untouched. Pairs with `ctx.scoped(scope)` (below): the flag makes the base methods safe, the view makes the safe path the only path. |
| `writeGate` | `{ check(action): Promise<{outcome,…}> }` | unset (no gate) | **Write-gate hook (§10.1).** When set, `remember()` emits a `memory.write` action and `await`s `writeGate.check(action)` **before** persisting; a `deny` outcome throws `WriteDeniedError` and the write does not commit (`allow`/`ask` proceed). Duck-typed — bareguard's `Gate` when embedded, any `.check`-shaped object standalone; litectx is not coupled to a gate version. Unset = byte-identical to a plain write. |
| `writeAudit` | `WriteAudit` | unset | **Standalone audit sink** — records one JSONL decision line per `remember()`. Fires whether or not a `writeGate` is wired: with a gate it logs the gate's decision; **without one it logs a synthetic `allow` (`reason: "no-gate"`)**, so a sink alone gives a complete write paper-trail. The sink (`opts.sink`) defaults to an in-memory `this.lines` array — the host wires a file/db writer. Ships **no** secret patterns: a host-supplied `redact(action)` scrubs (the §6 line — secret patterns are content judgment, the host's to supply). |
| `trace` | `boolean` | `false` | **contextgraph (observability).** When true, the instance is returned wrapped in `observe()` — every CE verb call is recorded into `ctx.trace` (a `ContextGraph`; `.json()` / `.mermaid()`). `ctx.tap(verb, fn)` folds in free-function verbs (`assemble`/`compress`/`summaryWindow`). Off = the bare instance, no proxy, zero overhead. Setup: `docs/03-usage/graphs.md`. |

There is **one** config object and no global state. No environment variables, no
config files — the adopter passes everything in.

> **Scope (§4.4) is opt-in and host-threaded.** Both keys default to unset, so the base behavior is
> byte-identical to an unscoped store: a missing scope reads as global/durable/visible. litectx **stores
> and filters** by these keys; it never resolves identity itself (no `git config` / OS calls in the
> constructor) — the host owns identity, either binding `owner`/`session` on the instance **or** threading
> a per-call `scope` (multis M4) for a single shared instance. The owner fence is a tri-state
> `(:memSeeAll = 1 OR owner IS NULL OR (:memOwner IS NOT NULL AND owner = :memOwner))` (seeAll = every
> owner; else own ∪ global; `GLOBAL` = shared tier only) plus the session predicate `(:sid IS NULL OR
> session IS NULL OR session = :sid)` — on **both** the BM25 and the embeddings/KNN paths, **and** the
> `reviewCandidates`/`promotionCandidates` ladder. `memOwner`/`memSeeAll` come from the per-call `scope`,
> falling back to the instance owner when none is passed (legacy = byte-identical). Scope lives in a
> non-FTS sibling table (`mem_scope`) so adding it needed no migration of existing data.

> **Doc-axis scope is a *separate* per-upload axis** from `owner`/`session`. Uploaded docs/blobs
> (`ingest`, `remember({kind:'doc'})`) carry a per-row `scope` string (a chat/customer id) in a
> `doc_scope` sidecar — passed per call, not bound to the instance. A *set* doc `scope` reads
> `scope ∪ NULL-global` (own uploads + the shared KB, never another scope). The danger is the
> **default**: with `strictScope` **off**, a missing doc `scope` reads/writes *every* tenant's rows
> (the single-tenant legacy default). On a shared store this is a footgun — turn on **`strictScope`**
> to make a missing scope **throw** (read *and* write), and use **`GLOBAL`** / **`ctx.scoped(scope)`**
> for the deliberate paths. `GLOBAL` is a read/write **sentinel, never a stored value** (it maps to
> `doc_scope.scope IS NULL`), so it needs no migration and leaves the `scope ∪ NULL` union intact.

## Public API

### `new LiteCtx(config)` → `LiteCtx`
Constructs an instance and opens (or creates) the SQLite store. Creates the
`dbPath` parent directory unless `dbPath === ":memory:"`.

### `await ctx.index(opts?)` → `Promise<IndexResult>`
Builds or **incrementally refreshes** the index over `root`.

- `opts.force?: boolean` — full rebuild (drop + reindex everything).
- `opts.paths?: string[]` — git pathspecs scoping this pass. A scoped pass
  **never deletes** files outside its scope.
- Default (no opts): re-reads only files whose content changed (fast skip on
  `(mtime, size)`, `content_hash` as the arbiter) and drops files that disappeared.

`IndexResult`:
```ts
{ files: number,      // total documents after the pass
  added: number,      // newly indexed
  updated: number,    // re-indexed (content changed)
  removed: number,    // dropped (no longer present)
  unchanged: number } // skipped (mtime/size or content unchanged)
```

#### Self-healing across a litectx upgrade

An index goes stale for a second reason nothing above catches: **litectx itself changed.** The chunker
decides where a chunk *starts* — and `(mtime, size)` cannot see that a newer chunker would have drawn
that boundary somewhere else. So an index built by an old litectx keeps serving the old boundaries
forever, silently, even after you upgrade the package.

So every index is **stamped** with a fingerprint of the litectx source that built it, and `index()`
**rebuilds automatically when the stamp doesn't match**. In practice:

| situation | cost |
|---|---|
| first index of a repo | full build (unchanged from before) |
| first `index()` after upgrading litectx | one full re-chunk |
| every other pass | incremental — a no-op is ~6 ms |

The rebuild clears **file-sourced rows only**. Written memory (`remember`, `ingest`, `stash`) is not
re-derivable from any file and survives it, exactly as it survives `force`.

A **`paths`-scoped pass never triggers the rebuild** — clearing the index inside one would delete files
the caller never mentioned, and a scoped pass never deletes outside its scope. Instead it **re-chunks
the files it does cover**, so a scoped caller still converges file by file, and it does **not** write
the stamp: only a pass over the whole index can vouch for the whole index. (So a consumer that *only*
ever indexes scoped subsets heals incrementally, on the files it touches, and its stamp stays stale
until it runs one full `index()`.)

The stamp is a **hash of litectx's own source**, not the package version — most releases don't touch
indexing, and stamping the version would force a needless re-chunk on every patch. It is stored in
SQLite's built-in `PRAGMA user_version`, so it costs no table and no migration; a pre-stamp index reads
as `0`, which never matches, so **the indexes already in the wild self-heal on their next pass**.
It over-triggers slightly (a change to an unrelated module also moves it) — the safe direction: an
unnecessary rebuild costs seconds, a skipped one serves wrong chunk boundaries indefinitely.

### `await ctx.recall(query, opts?)` → `Promise<Hit[] | Record<kind, Hit[]>>`
Ranked recall over the index, **scoped by memory `kind`**. **Async** (since slice 6 — the
embeddings tier embeds the query at call time; with embeddings off the work is synchronous,
just wrapped in a resolved promise, no model touched). `await` it.

**Kinds never share a ranking.** Each kind is FTS-gated and ranked only against its own
kind, in a separate query — so prose volume can never bury code (no weights, no md
penalty). Within a kind, ranking is **BM25 + 1-hop additive import-spreading** (a hit
adjacent to a strong hit in the import graph is lifted; spreading never crosses kinds and
is a no-op for kinds without edges, e.g. `doc`). With the **embeddings tier on**, a wider
BM25-gated pool is additionally re-ranked by semantic cosine (`norm(dual) + embedWeight·norm(cosine)`)
— the gate bounds the cosine work to the candidate pool, never the corpus. For the **written
kinds** (`fact`/`episode`) the tier goes one step further (slice 11): up to 8 stored vectors
nearest the query are **unioned into the pool as nominees**, so a paraphrase sharing *no* words
with a fact can still reach it — nominees enter at the pool's score floor and rank on cosine
alone, so lexical hits keep their head start. `code`/`doc` stay strictly gate-then-rerank. The
return shape follows the `kind` argument:

| call | mode | returns | default `n` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recall(q, { kind: "code" })` | single kind | flat `Hit[]` | `10` |
| `recall(q, { kind: ["code","fact"] })` | multiple | grouped `{ code:[…], fact:[…] }` | `5` each |
| `recall(q)` | omitted → all `KINDS` | grouped `{ code:[…], doc:[…], fact:[…], episode:[…] }` | `5` each |

- `opts.kind?: string | string[]` — one kind (flat list) or several (grouped). Omitted →
  grouped over **all four** known kinds (the safe CLI/agent default; never a flattened
  ranking). A kind with no content returns an empty array — honest, not an error.
- `opts.n?: number` — max hits **per kind**; raise to dig deeper. No hard cap, no
  pagination (a larger `n` is a larger context — your budget to manage).
- `opts.body?: boolean` (default `false`) — inline each hit's content as `hit.body`. Off by
  default: recall returns **pointers**, not payloads. Opt in to skip the follow-up `get()`s when
  mounting litectx as a memory store or feeding an assembler. Written memory comes back **verbatim**;
  a file hit returns its **localized chunk** (the indexed text that ranked — drift-free), or the
  whole file when nothing localized; `null` when the file is gone or the id is unknown. A **blob hit**
  (a byte-exact upload, R3) has no text body — `body` is `null`; fetch its bytes with `get(id).bytes`.
- `opts.scope?: string | typeof GLOBAL` — **fence per-tenant rows** to this scope. Spans BOTH per-upload
  axes: direct **doc/blob** rows (multis M3 R2) **and** **`fact`/`episode`** memory (multis M4 — `scope` →
  the per-call `mem_scope.owner`, so one shared instance fences memory per tenant). A tenant string returns
  `scope ∪ null-global` and **nothing from another tenant** — a chat sees its own uploads + facts + the
  global tier, never another chat's. `GLOBAL` returns **only** the shared tier. Unset = the instance owner's
  view (sees everything on an ownerless instance; backward-compatible) — **unless `strictScope` is on**,
  where an omitted scope on a doc- **or** memory-touching recall **throws** (a forgotten scope must be a loud
  error, not a silent all-tenant read). Only `code`/file rows are repo-global, never fenced; a `code`-only
  recall never requires a scope, strict or not. **Expired rows (`expiresAt`, set at `ingest`) are always
  excluded**, scope or not — a recall never returns a stale upload. **Fencing recall is only half of
  isolation** — pass the same `scope` to `get` too (ids are guessable); see `get`'s tenant-isolation note.
  The leak-proof pattern is `ctx.scoped(scope)`, which now fences every kind from a single instance.
- No usable query terms → `[]` (single kind) or all-empty groups.
- `opts.log?: boolean` (default `true`) — set `false` to skip the recall audit log. The log
  is a **demand signal**: queries from dashboards, CI checks, batch tooling, or a read-only
  db open aren't real demand and shouldn't pollute it.
- **Side effect (unless `log: false`):** every hit returned is appended to the **recall
  audit log** (slice 7) — the trail behind `reviewCandidates` and the future access-log
  activation tier. Each row records the hit's chunk symbol, so the future edit-bind can
  join "recalled" and "edited" at the same grain. Ranking is unaffected.

`Hit`:
```ts
{ path: string,    // repo-relative file path — or, for written memory, the caller's `id` key
  kind: string,    // "code" | "doc" | "fact" | "episode"

  score: number,   // higher = more relevant (BM25 + additive import-spreading)

  chunk: { symbol: string|null, nodeType: string,            // the best-matching chunk INSIDE the
           startLine: number, endLine: number } | null,      // hit — a function pointer, not just a file
  // written-memory grounding (slice 5c) — present on fact/episode hits, absent on indexed files:
  provenance?: "human" | "agent",  // validation status (signed-off vs the agent's own assertion)
  use?: number,                    // recall-demand count ('recall' rows only); a fresh memory reads 0
  occurredAt?: number|null,        // episode timestamp (epoch ms); null for facts
  cosine?: number,                 // raw query↔hit semantic similarity in [-1,1] (fact/episode + embeddings
                                   // tier only; absent otherwise) — the KNN cosine, surfaced verbatim
  body?: string | null,            // the hit's content — ONLY when called with { body: true } (see above)
  meta?: Record<string, unknown> } // opaque caller metadata (RT-3), verbatim; written memory only

### `ctx.get(id, opts?)` → `Item | null`
**Body access** (slice 9) — the read counterpart to `recall`: recall returns ranked
*pointers* (paths/ids), `get` returns the *thing itself*. Synchronous (no embedder
involved). Any id works:

- a **written-memory id** (`"fact:auth-uses-jwt"`) → the text **verbatim as remembered**
  (the FTS body is a processed searchable surface, never the deliverable);
- an **indexed file's repo-relative path** (`"src/auth.js"`) → the file **read fresh from
  disk** — the index stores the searchable surface, not a copy of your files, so you always
  see the current content (`text: null` only when the file has vanished since the last
  `index()`; the next pass sweeps the row).
- a **blob id** (a byte-exact upload, R3) → its **original bytes** in `bytes` (round-trips
  byte-identical), with `text: null`.

```ts
Item = {
  id: string,                        // the written id, or the repo-relative path
  kind: string,                      // "code" | "doc" | "fact" | "episode"
  format: string,                    // "ts" | "js" | "py" | "md" | "text" | "csv" | "xlsx" | ...
  source: "file" | "direct",         // indexed from disk vs written via remember()/ingest()
  provenance: "human"|"agent"|null,  // written memory only; null for files
  occurredAt: number | null,         // episode timestamp (epoch ms)
  text: string | null,               // the full body; null for a blob (bytes hold the payload)
  bytes: Buffer | null,              // a byte-exact upload's original bytes (R3); null otherwise
  meta: Record<string, unknown>|null,// opaque caller metadata, verbatim; null for files / none
}
```

#### Fetching ONE chunk — `get(path, { startLine, endLine })`

A recall hit points at a **symbol**, not a file. Pass that hit's `chunk.startLine` / `chunk.endLine`
back to `get` and `text` is **that chunk's body alone** — the answer the pointer promised, without
dragging its whole file through context. Since a chunk starts at its **doc-comment**, this is how you
get code *and* its docstring in one bounded read.

```js
const [hit] = await ctx.recall("keywords", { kind: "code", n: 1 });
// hit.chunk → { symbol: "keywords", nodeType: "function_declaration", startLine: 64, endLine: 71 }

ctx.get(hit.path, { startLine: hit.chunk.startLine, endLine: hit.chunk.endLine });
//  →  261 bytes: the JSDoc + the 7-line function
ctx.get(hit.path);
//  → 3474 bytes: the whole file
```

The line numbers are a **handle you hand back, never a range you compute**. They mean nothing except
against the file the index actually saw.

Which is why the fetch is **gated on the file's content hash**. If the file changed since it was
indexed, those line numbers now describe *different code* — slicing by them would return another
symbol's body, silently and with no error. So a drifted file throws **`StalePointerError`** instead of
guessing. When the hash matches, the indexed chunk and the live file are identical by construction, so
the stored body is served verbatim (no re-parse, ~0.6 ms).

Recover by re-running `index()` (a no-op pass is ~6 ms) and re-`recall`ing for a fresh pointer:

```js
import { StalePointerError } from "litectx";

try {
  item = ctx.get(path, { startLine, endLine });
} catch (e) {
  if (!(e instanceof StalePointerError)) throw e;
  await ctx.index();                       // the file moved on; re-chunk it
  [hit] = await ctx.recall(q, { kind: "code", n: 1 });   // fresh pointer
}
```

> **Why not `get(path, { symbol })`?** Because a symbol is not a reliable anchor and the failure is
> silent. Names are **duplicated** (`recall` is defined on both `LiteCtx` and `ScopedView`; a Python
> method and a module function routinely share a name), they are **renamed** by the very edits this

> blocks, preambles). A name-keyed lookup returns the *first* match — the wrong body, no error. Lines

A line range matching **no chunk** returns `null` — never a silent fallback to the whole file, which
would reintroduce the bloat invisibly. Written memory is stored whole and has no chunks, so asking it
for a range also returns `null`. Both `startLine` and `endLine` are required together.

`recall({ body: true })` serves bodies from the same gate: a hit whose file has drifted comes back with
**`body: null`** rather than the pre-edit text (it nulls the one hit instead of throwing, so a single
stale file can't blow up a whole result set). The hit itself still ranks — a drifted file is withheld,
not hidden.

Unknown id → `null`. An **expired** upload (`expiresAt` past — multis M3 R5) also returns `null`,
exactly as recall hides it. On the (pathological) collision of a written id with a real file
path, the written row wins — namespace your ids (`"fact:…"`) and it never comes up.

- `opts.log?: boolean` (default `true`) — each `get` appends an `action: 'fetch'` row to
  the audit log. A fetch is a **tagged weak signal, not demand**: you fetch what recall
  just returned, so counting fetches as demand would double-count every retrieval (the
  fetch-toll). `recallCount`/`reviewCandidates` read `action: 'recall'` rows only; nothing
  scores the fetch tag yet (it earns weight, if any, at the action-signal bench). Set
  `log: false` for non-demand consumers, same as `recall`.
- `opts.scope?: string | typeof GLOBAL` (multis M3 R2 / M4) — **fences the direct handle**, the same way
  `recall({ scope })` fences discovery, on **both** per-tenant axes: a `get` for a `doc`/blob tagged with a
  *different* `doc_scope.scope`, **or** a `fact`/`episode` owned by a *different* `mem_scope.owner` (multis
  M4), returns `null`. A global (null-scope/null-owner) row stays visible to every tenant; `GLOBAL` fetches
  **only** the shared tier (a tenant row reads as `null`). This closes the by-id leak on the memory axis too
  — fencing `recall` without `get` is only half the boundary (a guessed/known id must not cross tenants).
  Only `code`/file rows have no sidecar and are never fenced. Omit it and a `get` on the **doc/blob axis**
  is **unfenced by id** (a guessed `doc` id can cross `doc_scope`) — **unless `strictScope` is on**, where
  a **bare `get(id)` throws** (pass a tenant `scope` or `GLOBAL`). On the **memory axis** (`fact`/`episode`)
  a bare `get(id)` is fenced **by construction** (multis M4 W4): a tenant row is stored under an owner-
  qualified key, so a bare ownerless `get` can only reach a *global* row (or, on a single-tenant instance
  with an `owner` set at construction, that instance's own rows) — it can never reach another tenant's
  fact/episode even by a guessed id. Pass `{ scope }` to fetch a specific tenant's row.

### `ctx.scoped(scope)` → `ScopedView`
A **scope-bound view** (multis M3 fail-closed ask; extended to memory in M4) — a per-tenant handle over a
single shared instance. `ctx.scoped("chat-42")` returns a handle whose `recall` / `get` / `ingest` /
`remember` / `recentMemory` / `count` / `enumerate` / `reviewCandidates` / `promotionCandidates` carry that scope **automatically**,
so "forgot to pass a scope" becomes a non-existent code path (there is no per-call `scope` to omit). One
bound tenant string now fences **every fenceable kind** — doc/blob uploads (via `doc_scope`) **and**
`fact`/`episode` memory (via the per-call `mem_scope.owner`, M4) — so a single `LiteCtx` is a complete
multi-tenant store. This is the blessed multi-tenant pattern: pair it with `strictScope: true` and the leak
class is structurally impossible — the flag makes the *base* methods fail closed, the view makes the *safe*
path the only one a call site touches.

- `scope: string | typeof GLOBAL` — the bound scope (a tenant id, or `GLOBAL` for a shared-tier/KB view).
- The bound scope is **final**: any `scope` passed in a call's `opts` is ignored.
- A bad bind (no scope / `null` / a non-string non-`GLOBAL`) **throws at creation** — a scope-bound view
  with no scope is the very footgun this closes, so it can't be constructed. (Throws even when
  `strictScope` is off — the view's own invariant.)
- Returns a `ScopedView` exposing `recall`, `get`, `ingest`, `remember`, `forget`, `recentMemory`,
  `count`, `enumerate`, `reviewCandidates`, `promotionCandidates` with the same signatures **minus** `opts.scope`.
  `forget()` / `forget({ kind })` deletes only the bound tenant's `fact`+`episode` memory; `forget({ id })`
  / `forget({ idPrefix })` delete one of its rows **by key**, tenant-fenced (a foreign id → `0`).
  `impact`/`index`/`recent` are not on the view (they're the repo-global code/edit axes, never tenant-fenced).

```js
import { LiteCtx, GLOBAL } from "litectx";
const ctx = new LiteCtx({ root, dbPath, strictScope: true }); // base methods fail closed
const chat = ctx.scoped(`chat-${chatId}`);                    // bind once
await chat.ingest(buf, { filename });                          // writes are scoped — nothing to forget
const hits = await chat.recall("invoice total", { kind: "doc" }); // reads scope ∪ global, never another chat
await chat.remember(`fact:${id}`, "prefers metric units", { kind: "fact" }); // memory fenced too (M4)
const facts = await chat.recall("units preference", { kind: "fact" });        // this chat's facts ∪ global
const kb = ctx.scoped(GLOBAL);                                 // a deliberate shared-tier view
await kb.ingest(policyPdf, { filename: "refund-policy.pdf" }); // publish to the KB, explicitly
```

### `await ctx.impact(symbol)` → `Promise<Impact | null>`
The **impact** view (§7): *if I change this symbol, what's the blast radius and how risky?*
**Computed on demand, not persisted** — callees by a tree-sitter walk of the symbol's body,
callers by an `rg -w` sweep confirmed with tree-sitter. No LSP, ever. Returns `null` when the
symbol isn't defined in the index (impact answers for *your* symbols). Async (it shells `rg`).

```ts
Impact = {
  symbol: string,
  defs: { path: string, startLine: number, endLine: number }[],  // every definition (over-count: all)
  refCount: number,     // max(confirmed, mentions) — the over-count-safe blast radius
  confirmed: number,    // tree-sitter-confirmed external call sites
  mentions: number,     // external `rg -w` word occurrences (the safety floor)
  risk: "low" | "medium" | "high",   // bucket on refCount: ≤2 / 3–10 / 11+
  complexity: number,   // cyclomatic-ish decision-point count (max over defs)
  callers: { path: string, line: number, symbol: string | null, alias?: string }[],  // confirmed call sites (incl. bare `@decorator` applications; `alias` set when reached via a renamed barrel re-export)
  callees: string[],    // intra-repo names this symbol calls (externals dropped)
  hedges: string[],     // §7.2 safety caveats — see below
}
```

**The safety model (§7.2) is the whole point.** Over-count is safe (over-cautious); under-count is
dangerous (a false "isolated → safe" breaks hidden consumers). So:
- `refCount` is `max(confirmed, mentions)` — the **looser** signal wins, never the smaller one.
  Resolution is by **name only** (no receiver typing — that's the LSP we don't have), so a common
  method name reads as higher-risk. That is intended: cautious, not precise (calibration borrowed
  from aurora's `lsp_tool`, thresholds ≤2/3–10/11+).
- **"isolated / low-risk" is never silent.** When `refCount` is 0 or all mentions are unconfirmed,
  `hedges` explains why — an unconfirmed mention is *counted, not dropped* ("unresolved ≠ absent"),
  and an exported/public name is flagged for invisible external consumers. A clean isolation verdict
  is never returned; it's always a hedged *review candidate*.
- **Renamed barrel / path-alias re-exports are resolved** (slice 5b). A symbol reached only as a
  renamed re-export — `export { default as Panel } from "./impl"`, imported via a tsconfig `paths`
  alias and called as `Panel()` — is invisible to a name-only sweep; `impact()` follows the barrel
  and tsconfig `paths` to find the real callers (tagged with `caller.alias`) and a hedge naming the
  alias, so it no longer reads as a false isolation. Single-hop barrels and JS/TS only — multi-hop
  barrel chains and Python `from x import y as z` re-export barrels are not yet followed.

### `ctx.getNode(id)` → `GraphNode | null`
The **graph substrate** (R-G1): describe one node's *structure* — the counterpart to `get`, which
returns its *body*. The graph is first-class public API; recall and impact are views over it, and so
is the example code-map (`examples/graph-view/`). **Kind-agnostic** — an indexed file's repo-relative
path returns a file node (its symbols as `chunks` + exact import-edge counts); a written-memory id
returns a zero-chunk, zero-edge node. Edge counts are over the **persisted `import` graph (exact)** —
call relationships are `impact()`'s on-demand job, never persisted as edges. Sync; `null` if unknown.

```ts
GraphNode = {
  id: string, kind: string, format: string,
  source: "file" | "direct",
  provenance?: "human" | "agent",        // written memory only
  git: { commits, lastCommit } | null,   // file activity (grounding, not scored); null for written memory
  chunks: { symbol: string|null, nodeType: string, startLine: number, endLine: number }[],  // [] for written memory
  edges: { imports: number, importedBy: number },  // EXACT persisted import-edge counts
}
```

### `ctx.related(id, opts?)` → `{ items: RelatedNode[], truncated: boolean }`
The **graph navigator** (R-G2): walk the persisted edge graph from `id`. BFS over `opts.edge` edges
(`"import"` is the only persisted type today — `call`/blast is `impact()`). `opts.dir`: `"out"` = what
`id` imports, `"in"` = what imports it, `"both"` = the neighbourhood (default). `opts.hops` = BFS depth
(default 1, **hard-capped at 3**; `truncated` flags when a larger request was clamped). Deduped,
nearest-hop-wins, excludes the seed. `edge` is a **generic type** so future non-code edges
(`derived_from`/`supersedes`) slot in unchanged once a producer emits them. Sync.

```ts
RelatedNode = { id: string, kind: string|null, format: string|null, hops: number, via: "out"|"in" }
```
Invariant: `getNode(id).edges.imports === related(id,{dir:"out",hops:1}).items.length` (and
`importedBy` ↔ `dir:"in"`). The exact import graph is the *map*; `impact()` is the fuzzy risk *readout*
laid over it — never drawn as edges (so a probabilistic signal can't masquerade as precise structure).

### `await ctx.remember(id, text, opts?)` → `Promise<void>`
Write one **directly-authored memory** — knowledge that isn't a file (slice 7). The write
counterpart to `index()`. **Tenant-fenced upsert by `(scope, id)`** (multis M4 W4): writing the
same id again **under the same scope** replaces the content in place (one row, the latest — a
restated fact never piles up); the **same id under a *different* scope is a separate row**, so one
tenant can never overwrite another's memory by id. The supersede key is `(scope, id)` — detecting
"same subject, new value" is your job; litectx guarantees the keyed, fenced upsert. The `id` is your
handle for forget — namespace it (`"fact:auth-uses-jwt"`, `"faq:refunds"`, `"ep:2026-06-09-deploy"`);
it appears as the hit's `path` in recall (the public id — internally a tenant row is keyed by an
owner-qualified key, but that prefix never surfaces and the id round-trips back through `get`).

- `opts.kind?: "fact" | "episode" | "doc"` — default `"fact"`.
  - **`fact`** — a durable, decontextualized assertion ("we use JWT"). No timestamp.
  - **`episode`** — a time-stamped event ("deploy rolled back on …"). `occurredAt` applies.
  - **`doc`** — a prose passage handed to you at runtime (an FAQ/KB entry with no file).
  - `code` is rejected — code enters via `index()` only.
- `opts.by?: "human" | "agent"` — **provenance** (who asserted it), default `"agent"`.
  The trust axis: human-asserted is durable/high-trust; agent-asserted is tentative until
  promoted (see `reviewCandidates`). Stored now; trust-*weighted ranking* is 🚧 roadmap.
- `opts.occurredAt?: number` — episode timestamp, epoch **ms**; defaults to write-time.
  Ignored for facts/docs (a durable assertion has no constitutive "when").
- `opts.format?: string` — defaults to `"md"` for docs, `"text"` otherwise. Metadata only
  for direct writes (nothing is chunked or parsed).
- `opts.meta?: Record<string, unknown>` — an **opaque caller dict** (RT-3), stored verbatim and
  returned untouched by `get`/`recall` (as `.meta`). It lives in **no FTS table** — never tokenized,
  searched, or scored — so it's the sealed passthrough that lets litectx stand in as a generic
  key-value memory store (see `liteCtxAsStore`). Keep it to **small structured tags** (`{ sessionId,
  tag, author }`); park large payloads in `stash`, not here. Re-`remember`ing without `meta` clears
  any prior meta (the latest write wins, like the text).
- `opts.injectionRisk?: "low" | "medium" | "high"` — an **optional guardrails shape flag** forwarded
  to a wired `writeGate` action. litectx core never computes it (the §6 line — content judgment is the
  guardrails tier's / gate's job); it only passes through what a caller sets. Ignored when no `writeGate`.
- `opts.expiresAt?: number` — **doc-axis only.** A retention timestamp here applies to a `kind:"doc"`
  row (same as `ingest`'s `expiresAt`); on a **`fact`/`episode` it is ignored** — the memory axis has
  **no per-row TTL** (episodes self-prune on a 30-day rolling window, facts are durable until `forget`).
  So don't set a fact "expiry" expecting it to lapse; model expiry as content + an explicit `forget`.

**Write-gate (§10.1, opt-in via `writeGate` config).** When a `writeGate` is wired, `remember()` first
builds a gate-able action `{ type: "memory.write", kind, provenance: by, text, id, meta?, injectionRisk? }`
(via the exported `toWriteAction`) and `await`s `writeGate.check(action)` **before any side effect**. A
`deny` outcome throws `WriteDeniedError` (carrying `.id` + `.decision`) and **nothing persists** — a denied
write is a true no-op (no embedding computed, no episode prune, no row written); `allow`/`ask` proceed to
the write. litectx states the **source** (`provenance`) + an optional `injectionRisk` flag; the gate
renders deny/ask — litectx never makes the content verdict. Default (no `writeGate`) is unchanged.

**Audit is decoupled from the gate.** A `writeAudit` records one decision line per `remember()` whenever
it is set — gate or not. With a gate it logs the gate's decision (and `deny` still blocks); **without a
gate every write is logged as a synthetic `allow` with `reason: "no-gate"`**, so you get a complete
write paper-trail from a sink alone (no need to stand up a permissive gate). Host `redact` scrubs in both
cases. This makes `WriteAudit` usable as the standalone paper-trail its name implies.

```js
import { LiteCtx, WriteAudit } from "litectx";
import fs from "node:fs";

const lc = new LiteCtx({
  root,
  writeAudit: new WriteAudit({
    sink:   (line)   => fs.appendFileSync("memory-audit.jsonl", JSON.stringify(line) + "\n"), // default: in-memory `audit.lines`
    redact: (action) => ({ ...action, text: scrub(action.text) }),  // litectx ships NO patterns — you supply them
  }),
  // writeGate: someGate,   // OPTIONAL — add only for deny/ask (e.g. bareguard); the audit works without it
});
// every remember() now appends one JSONL line — AND so does every liteCtxAsStore(lc).store(),
// since the adapter writes through remember() (below). Wire the sink once on `lc`; consumers stay transparent.
```

Content is stored **whole** — one searchable unit, no tree-sitter/section chunking. You
control granularity by how you split before writing (ten atomic facts beat one blob).
With the embeddings tier on, `remember` embeds the text at write time (hence async).

Written memory **coexists with the index in one store and survives every `index()`
pass** — structurally: `index()` reconciles deletions only against files it has itself
indexed, and written rows are never in that set. This includes `index({ force: true })`:
a force pass clears and re-reads **file-sourced data only** — written memory, its raw
text/embeddings, and the audit log are never touched (nothing about them is re-derivable
from disk).

### `await ctx.ingest(buffer, opts?)` → `Promise<{ id, kind: "doc", format, mode: "chunked" | "blob", chunks }>`
Ingest an **uploaded file** (bytes + filename) — the third ingest path, distinct from `index()` (sweeps a
disk root) and `remember()` (stores text whole, unchunked). Built for the **chat-upload flow**: bytes in, no
on-disk file needed. Routed by **filename extension**:

- **md / pdf / docx → chunkable** (`mode: "chunked"`). Converted to markdown, split into segments, each
  stored as its own `source='direct'` doc row, so `recall(query, { kind: "doc", body: true })` surfaces the
  matching passage:
  - **md** → segmented directly (headings → the markdown chunker, one section per segment; flat → packed).
  - **PDF** (`pdfjs-dist`) → flat text (lossy: reading order best-effort, tables degrade, **scanned/image-only
    PDFs are not OCR'd** — clear "no extractable text"). With no headings/blank lines, paragraphs are
    **reconstructed from the vertical gap between lines**, then packed — **whole paragraphs only** — under
    ~800 chars. A **paragraph or word is never split or truncated**; the lone exception is a single paragraph
    longer than the cap, which rides whole. This text-layer extraction is **deliberately not ML-grade** — the
    output feeds a recall index (BM25/embeddings key off terms, not layout), so heavyweight layout/table/OCR
    fidelity buys nothing here and would cost the lean, offline base install. **For complex-layout PDFs**
    (multi-column, dense tables, scanned pages), run your own converter — e.g. an ML extractor like
    [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU) or [markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) —
    in your pipeline and `ingest()` the resulting markdown with a `.md` filename. Heavy extraction lives at the
    consumer's edge; litectx owns chunking + recall, not document fidelity.
  - **DOCX** (`mammoth.convertToMarkdown`) → markdown that **keeps heading structure**; one section per segment.
  - **txt / text / log / csv** → **already plaintext** (no parser, no peer dep). Packed into passage-sized
    segments — **blank-line paragraphs where present, else individual lines** (line-oriented logs/CSV) — under
    ~800 chars, same whole-paragraph/line packing (never split or truncated). **No heading semantics**: a
    leading `#` in a `.log`/`.txt` is literal text, never a section. CSV is chunked as **raw text** (a columnar
    parse is out of scope). `format` is `"txt"|"log"|"csv"` (`"text"`→`"txt"`).
  - Rows carry **`format` under `kind: "doc"`**, rank alongside file `md` docs, and
    **survive every `index()` pass** (they're `direct`). Segments are stored `"<id>#0"`, `"<id>#1"`, ….
- **everything else** (xlsx / xml / **code** / binary) → **stored BYTE-EXACT as a blob** (`mode: "blob"`,
  `chunks: 0`). The bytes are kept verbatim (a SQLite `BLOB` — round-trips byte-identical, including non-UTF8);
  only the **filename** is indexed for recall, the body is **never parsed or chunked**, and `get(id)` returns
  the **original bytes** (`item.bytes`, with `item.text === null`). litectx is the single durable store — keep
  no parallel file store. Want body-search for those types? Convert and send `md`/`pdf`/`docx` — opt-in, never forced.

`opts`:
- `filename?: string` — drives extension routing (`"manual.pdf"` → chunkable pdf; `"notes.txt"` → chunkable text; `"q3.xlsx"` → blob). Also derives the `id`.
- `format?: string` — explicit override when the filename is absent/misleading (`"pdf"`, `"csv"`, …).
- `id?: string` — stable **base id** (else derived from the filename, e.g. `"doc:manual"`). **Re-ingesting the
  same `id` is an upsert** — prior segments **and** any prior blob are dropped first (no orphans, even across a
  chunked↔blob switch).
- `scope?: string` — **per-upload recall scope** (e.g. a chat id). A `recall({ scope })` returns `scope ∪
  null-global` and **nothing from another scope** (one customer's uploads fenced from another's; the global,
  unscoped knowledge base stays visible from any scope). Unset = **global** (default; backward-compatible).
- `expiresAt?: number` — **retention** (epoch ms). Once past, the row is **excluded from `recall`/`get`** and
  its storage (bytes and all) is reclaimed by `purge()`. Unset = **keep forever** (default). The consumer
  computes the TTL/policy; litectx honors it.
- `meta?: Record<string, unknown>` — opaque passthrough (e.g. `{ chat: "c-42" }`), attached to every segment/blob.
- `maxSize?: number` (default **10 MB**, also caps a blob), `maxPages?: number` (**2000**), `parseTimeoutMs?:
  number` (**30 s**) — the **untrusted-input bounds** (§ below).

**Untrusted input is bounded; failures are clear and write nothing.** Oversized / over-page / corrupt /
encrypted / no-text inputs throw a **specific** error and leave the index intact (never a crash, never a
garbage row). `maxSize` and `maxPages` are deterministic caps; `parseTimeoutMs` is a **per-page** wall-clock
budget checked between pages (it bounds a many-page document — a single pathological page is bounded by
`maxSize`/`maxPages`, since JS can't preempt synchronous CPU work without a worker thread). PDF JS execution
and `eval` are disabled (`isEvalSupported: false`, scripting/XFA off — mitigating the pdf.js font-path RCE
class), and DOCX XML is parsed without external-entity resolution (no XXE file-read / SSRF). A **blob is never
parsed**, so it carries none of these parser risks — only the `maxSize` cap.

> **Deploying with fully-untrusted uploads (e.g. a public chat).** Two residual limits are inherent to
> in-process parsing, so handle them at the call site: (1) `maxSize` bounds the **input** bytes, not the
> **decompressed** size — a 10 MB zip/PDF stream can inflate far larger in memory (a decompression bomb), so
> keep `maxSize` conservative and run the host under a memory limit; (2) a CPU-bound parse **cannot be
> interrupted** by `parseTimeoutMs`, so a malicious single-page document can block the event loop — for
> hostile input, call `ingest` inside a **worker thread** (or subprocess) you can terminate. These
> are deployment choices litectx can't make for you; the in-library bounds are the floor, not the ceiling.

**Optional peer deps, lazy-loaded.** `pdfjs-dist` and `mammoth` are **optional** (like the embeddings tier):
`npm i litectx` stays lean and offline-capable, and neither is imported until the **first** chunkable
(`pdf`/`docx`) ingest — a blob or md ingest needs neither. If a parser is missing, the call throws a helpful
`npm i pdfjs-dist` / `npm i mammoth` message. **Scope vs. owner:** `scope` (this method, per-upload) is a
distinct axis from the instance `owner`/`session` (which scope `fact`/`episode`). Code/file rows are always
global on the `scope` axis.

> **`writeGate` screens the chunkable path only; blob writes are not gated.** A wired gate runs per
> segment on md/pdf/docx (via `remember`), but a **blob bypasses it** — by design, not oversight. The gate
> judges searchable *text* for injection-risk; blob bytes are opaque and never reach an LLM (the one path
> that turns a blob into context is converting + re-ingesting as md/pdf/docx, which *is* gated). Screen
> uploads at the call site (size/type/AV), keep the egress-trust rule above, and don't assume `writeGate`
> covers blobs.

```js
// chat-upload flow: bytes in (no file on disk), fenced to a chat, kept 90 days
const { id, format, mode, chunks } = await ctx.ingest(uploadBuffer, {
  filename: "acme-manual.pdf",
  scope: "chat-42",
  expiresAt: Date.now() + 90 * 86_400_000,
  meta: { chat: "c-42" },
});
// → { id: "doc:acme-manual", kind: "doc", format: "pdf", mode: "chunked", chunks: 7 }
const hits = await ctx.recall("how do I reset the device", { kind: "doc", body: true, scope: "chat-42" });

// a spreadsheet upload: stored byte-exact, found by name, fetched back verbatim
await ctx.ingest(xlsxBuffer, { filename: "q3-sales.xlsx", scope: "chat-42" });
const [hit] = await ctx.recall("q3 sales", { kind: "doc", scope: "chat-42" });
const file = ctx.get(hit.path); // → { ..., format: "xlsx", text: null, bytes: <Buffer, byte-exact> }
```

### `ctx.purge(opts?)` → `number`
Reclaim **expired** uploads (the retention sweep's mechanism — the consumer owns the *schedule*, litectx owns
the *delete*). Every direct doc/blob row whose `expiresAt <= now` (`opts.now`, default `Date.now()`) is deleted
and its storage — including byte-exact blob bytes — freed, leaving no orphans. Returns the count reclaimed.
Note `recall`/`get` already **exclude** expired rows the instant they expire, so `purge()` is storage
reclamation, not a correctness gate. Only rows with a non-null, elapsed `expiresAt` are touched.

### `ctx.forget(idOrQuery)` → `number`
Delete directly-written memory. Returns the number of rows removed.

- `forget("fact:auth-uses-jwt")` — drop one item by key.
- `forget({ id })` / `forget({ idPrefix })` — **precise** by-key deletes on the object form. `id` ==
  the string form (one row); `idPrefix` drops a base id **and all its `<base>#<n>` segments** (the
  clean-re-ingest handle for a multi-segment `ingest` doc) — `#`-anchored, so `forget({ idPrefix:
  "kb:guide" })` spares a sibling `kb:guidebook`. Explicit by-key targets: **not** subject to the
  `strictScope` throw (that guards omission-based blind wipes, not by-id deletes). Ids are guessable —
  a shared-store host should namespace them. (Does **not** combine with `scope` — see below.)
- `forget({ kind: "fact", by: "agent" })` — **owner-blind bulk invalidation** by query: every
  agent-asserted fact, **across every tenant**. At least one of `kind` / `by` is required — `forget({})`
  throws, enforced at both the public wrapper and the store layer, so an empty selector can never wipe
  all memory. (Owner-blind by design — only safe on a single-tenant instance.)
- `forget({ scope, kind? })` — **tenant-fenced** (multis M4): deletes **only that owner's** `fact` +
  `episode` rows (optionally one `kind`) — the delete-side mirror of the `recall` owner fence. A tenant
  string → `mem_scope.owner = scope`; **`GLOBAL`** → the shared tier (`owner IS NULL`) **only**, never a
  tenant's rows (a tenant forget is the stricter `owner = scope`, *not* the read fence's `owner ∪ global`
  — else it would wipe the shared memory for everyone). **Mem-axis only:** a tenant's `doc`/blob uploads
  (separate `doc_scope` axis), other tenants' rows, and the stash are untouched. Prefer the bound
  `ctx.scoped(tenant).forget()` (no scope to omit). Under `strictScope`, a **scope-less** memory forget
  (`forget({})` or owner-blind `forget({ kind })`) **throws** — a tenant-blind wipe is unexpressible by
  omission.
- `forget({ scope, id })` / `forget({ scope, idPrefix })` — **tenant-fenced delete-by-key** (Feature B):
  `{ id }` / `{ idPrefix }` **combine** with the fence to drop **one row / one id's `#`-segments for that
  owner only** — the delete-side mirror of the `(scope, id)` upsert (supersede). The fence is
  **structural**: it matches the owner-qualified physical key, so a *foreign* tenant's id matches nothing
  and returns **`0`** (the fence, not id-matching, decides — exactly like a cross-tenant `get`). This
  retires the "scoped-`get` to verify, then owner-blind delete" bridge (which was safe only if ids were
  globally unique). `{ scope, by }` **still throws** (`by` is owner-blind provenance; combined with a
  fence it is the omission footgun — `scoped(A).forget({ by })` would inject `scope: A` and wipe all of A;
  use base `forget({ by })` for an owner-blind provenance delete). Reachable via the bound
  `ctx.scoped(tenant).forget({ id })`.

**`forget` can never touch indexed files** — it operates only on written
(`remember`-created) rows. To remove an indexed file from the store, delete the file and
re-`index()`. **`forget` is memory-only** — it does **not** reach the stash table; clean parked
payloads with `evict` (below).

### `ctx.stash(id, text)` → `void`
Park a payload in the **keyed agent-context store** — the durable half of *restorable compression*
(R-C4). Drop a large payload (a tool result, a fetched page, a file dump) out of your context window,
keep only the cheap `id`; `get(id)` rehydrates the full text on demand and `evict(id)` drops it.

- A stash is **not memory.** It lives in no FTS table, so `recall` **never** surfaces it — on any
  kind — and it is **never auto-pruned** (unlike episodes), so a restore always works. Reachable only
  by exact `id`.
- Upsert by `id` (also the rehydrate/evict handle — namespace it, e.g. `"stash:toolresult-42"`).
- Sync, and never embedded (a stash isn't meaning-searchable — that's the point).

*Library API only, by design — not a CLI or MCP tool. Parking a payload is a runtime mechanic the
host loop performs, not a call a reasoning model makes; the MCP surface stays the model's verbs
(recall/remember/impact).*

### `ctx.peek(id)` → `{ id, bytes, head, tail, createdAt, truncated } | null`
The **read-half of `stash`** — *handle / lazy-load* (R-I3). A cheap **head+tail** preview of a parked
blob *without* rehydrating it: where `get(id)` pays the whole payload's tokens back, `peek` returns only
the handle — `head` (a fixed-length prefix), `tail` (a fixed-length suffix — the *conclusion*: exit
code, failing frame, closing structure), `bytes` (the true octet size), `createdAt` (parked-at, ms), and
`truncated` (whether a middle span is elided). Reason over the handle; call `get(id)` to load the full
body **only if you decide you need it**. `null` for an unknown id.

- **Head+tail, not head-only.** For the payloads stash holds — logs, traces, tool results — the verdict
  is at the END, so a head-only preview would miss it. `tail` is empty when `head` already holds the
  whole payload (no middle to elide).
- **Bounded result, not bounded compute.** Only ~head+tail bytes return to the caller regardless of
  payload size — the blob stays out of your context/token budget (the point of a lazy-load handle).
  This is *not* a DB-time win: SQLite reads the column to `substr`/`length` it, so peek's local compute
  scales with payload (measured comparable to `get`, slower past a few MB — `get` directly if you'll
  load it anyway). An O(1) peek would need the byte size stored at write time (a deferred column).
- **Truncation is signalled, never lossy.** `truncated` + `bytes` tell you the preview omits a span; the
  untruncated body is always one `get(id)` away. `peek` is a read-only view.
- **Stash-only.** `recall` owns ranked retrieval over memory; a stash is a dumb keyed blob, so `peek`
  carries no weights and no ranking. `peek` on a memory id or a file path returns `null`.
- Library API only, same rationale as `stash`.

### `ctx.evict(idOrPolicy)` → `number`
The **cleanup-half of `stash`** (R-C4 / R-G7) — the runtime's stash deleter. Returns the count removed.

- **`evict(id)`** drops one parked payload; **`evict({ olderThan })`** drops anything parked before an
  epoch-ms floor; **`evict({ maxCount })`** keeps only the newest N by parked-at and drops the rest. Pass
  both `olderThan` and `maxCount` to apply them in turn (age first, then count). An empty policy throws.
- **Stash-only, by construction.** Unlike `forget` (which invalidates durable memory), `evict` touches
  **only** the `stash` table — a bulk age/size sweep can **never** reach a `fact`/`episode`. That safety
  is why the two are separate verbs (not one overloaded `forget`).
- **The runtime owns the policy; litectx owns the delete.** *Which* stashes are stale and *when* to sweep
  is the orchestration loop's call (e.g. bareagent); `evict` is the mechanism it calls.
- Library API only, same rationale as `stash` (orchestration plumbing, never a model-facing verb).

### `ctx.reviewCandidates(threshold = 5, opts?)` → `{ path, hits }[]`
The **human-in-the-loop promotion query** (review earned by use): agent-asserted facts
whose recall-hit count has crossed `threshold`, most-recalled first. The intended loop is
**yours, not litectx's**: show each candidate to a human, who either **validates** it —
`remember(id, text, { by: "human" })`, flipping provenance to durable/high-trust — or
**invalidates** it — `forget(id)`. Acting on a candidate removes it from the set (no
"reviewed" flag exists or is needed). The hit count gates *review*, never *ranking* —
frequently-recalled facts do not rank higher (that would be a feedback loop; ranking
weight is the 🚧 access-log tier, validated separately).
`opts.scope` (`string | GLOBAL`, multis M4) **fences the queue to one tenant** on a shared
instance — exactly like `recall({kind:'fact', scope})` (tenant → that owner's facts; `GLOBAL`
→ shared tier; omitted → the instance owner, or **throws** under `strictScope`). Prefer the
bound `ctx.scoped(tenant).reviewCandidates(threshold)` so the scope can't be forgotten.

### `ctx.promotionCandidates(threshold = 10, opts?)` → `{ path, hits }[]`
The **episode promotion query** — the agent-side first rung of the ladder (`reviewCandidates`
is the human-side second rung). Returns **agent-written `episode`s** recalled at least
`threshold` times within the **30-day rolling active window**, most-recalled first. Episodes are
the agent's *ephemeral scratchpad* (its own synthesized gotchas); they graduate by **use** into
durable facts. The intended loop is **yours**: read each candidate (`get(id)`), then write a
distilled `fact` — `remember(id, text, { kind: "fact", by: "agent" })` — which then rides the
`reviewCandidates(5)` → human-validate path above. **litectx flags, never summarizes** (no
extraction LLM): it gives the trigger; your agent writes the fact.

The count gates **distillation, never ranking** — a hot episode does not rank higher (the
feedback loop §4 forbids). Threshold defaults higher than facts' review (**10 vs 5**) because
episodes are noisier and more numerous. `opts.scope` fences the queue to one tenant exactly like
`reviewCandidates` (multis M4; prefer `ctx.scoped(tenant).promotionCandidates(threshold)`). Two
ephemerality rules keep the scratchpad bounded:
- **Soft-decay:** an episode older than 30 days drops out of this candidate set (the window gate).
- **Auto-prune:** each new episode `remember()` hard-deletes episodes past the 30-day window
  (cascading their text/embedding/recall-log) — self-bounding, no cron. Anything that mattered was
  already distilled into a fact, and **facts never prune**, so nothing earned is lost.

Unlike `reviewCandidates`, distilling does **not** remove the episode (there's no provenance to
flip) — it ages out of the window, or you `forget(id)` it after distilling. Re-distilling is
harmless: your fact `id` is a stable handle, so a second pass upserts the same fact.

### `ctx.recentActivity(opts?)` → `{ id, symbol, kind, lastEditedAt, edits }[]`
**"What was I working on"** — the code/doc chunks litectx most recently *witnessed* being
edited, newest first, within a recency window. `opts`: `days` (lookback, default 7),
`since` (epoch-ms window floor, overrides `days`), `limit` (default 20). Each row is a chunk:
`id` is its file path (feed it to `get`), `symbol` localizes within the file (`null` for a
file's anonymous chunks, which collapse to a single per-file row), `lastEditedAt` is the most
recent observed edit (epoch ms), and `edits` is how many index passes (sessions) changed it
in the window.

The edit stream is built **at index time**: each incremental `index()` diffs every new chunk
body against the stored `nodes` and logs the new/modified ones. A **cold first build or
`force` rebuild records nothing** (mass-loading isn't editing), so this stays empty until real
edits are observed — it reflects what litectx watched, not history before it was watching.

This is a **deliberately isolated read**: it never touches recall ranking. The witnessed-edit
signal's home is here (next-use / "where was I"), *not* in search scores — folding edit
activation into recall was POC-falsified as repo-dependent (it floats the same hot chunks for
every query), so the edit→recall re-rank ships at zero. `recentActivity` also writes nothing
to the recall audit log — it is not a demand signal.

### `ctx.recentMemory(opts?)` → `(Omit<Hit, "score"> & { createdAt, occurredAt? })[]`
**Recent written memory, newest first** — the recency sibling of `recall`, for the empty-FTS-match
fallback. When a query carries no usable term (an all-stopword *"what did I say"*), `recall` returns
`[]` (there is no relevance to rank on); call `recentMemory` to ground the agent on its latest memory
for the scope instead. The **consumer owns the policy** (whether/when to fall back); litectx owns the
mechanism — so it is a separate verb, not a `recall` flag (which would mix recency into a relevance
ranking and pollute the demand signal):

```js
let hits = await ctx.recall(q, { kind: "doc", scope, body: true });
if (!hits.length) hits = ctx.recentMemory({ scope, body: true });   // doc recency fallback

// the conversation window: this tenant's latest episodes, newest-first, role carried in meta
const turns = ctx.scoped(tenant).recentMemory({ kind: "episode", n: 20, body: true });
```

**Two axes, picked by `kind`** (multis M3 doc → M4 memory):
- `kind` omitted or `"doc"` → the **doc axis** (default; unchanged). Direct `doc` rows (those written
  via `ingest`/`remember`, blobs by filename), ordered by write time, fenced to `scope ∪ null-global`
  on `doc_scope.scope`, **expiry-aware** (expired excluded). Each row carries `createdAt` (epoch ms;
  `null` only for a doc written before this field shipped, which sorts last).
- `kind: "fact" | "episode"` (or an array of them) → the **memory axis** (M4 R3). `fact`/`episode`
  rows for the tenant, ordered by **`occurredAt` (episodes) / `createdAt` (facts)** newest-first,
  fenced on `mem_scope.owner` (`tenant ∪ shared`, session-aware) — the **same** fence as `recall`/`get`
  on memory, so KNN can't bypass it and neither can this. No per-row expiry on this axis (episode
  staleness is the 30-day prune; pruned rows are already gone). Each row adds `occurredAt` (epoch ms;
  `null` for a fact).
  > **Conversation-window gotcha (episodes are session-fenced).** Episodes are fenced by `session` as
  > well as owner (recency is not a ranking term, so a run's own episodes mustn't be buried by another's
  > — see the `session` config). So `recentMemory({ kind: 'episode' })` returns **only the current
  > session's** episodes when a `session` is set. To use it as a conversation window that **survives a
  > restart**, construct the instance **without an explicit `session`** (episodes write `session=NULL` →
  > always visible) or reuse a **stable** session id per chat; otherwise each restart's window starts
  > empty. **Facts are unaffected** (always cross-session).

The two axes resolve scope differently (`doc_scope` vs `mem_scope.owner`), so a single call mixes **one
axis only** — `doc` together with `fact`/`episode` **throws** (call once per axis). `opts`: `scope`
(tenant string or `GLOBAL`), `kind` (above), `n` (cap, default 10), `body` (inline verbatim text,
default off — `null` for a blob). Returns `recall`-shaped hits plus the time fields above and the opaque
`meta` when present — **where the caller parks `role`/turn markers for faithful history reconstruction;
litectx never parses the stored text**. Under `strictScope` a missing `scope` **throws** (either axis).
Like `recentActivity`, it writes nothing to the recall audit log (recency is not query-demand). Sync.

### `ctx.count(opts?)` → `number`
**Per-tenant memory count by kind** (multis M4 O1) — for *"you have N facts / M episodes / K docs
here"* surfaces (`/memory`, `/docs`) without pulling rows. Tenant-fenced + expiry-aware on the **same**
predicates as `recall`/`recentMemory`: `fact`/`episode` fence on `mem_scope.owner`, direct `doc` on
`doc_scope.scope` (expired excluded). A count is purely additive, so `kind` **may span both axes** in
one call — each kind is counted under its own fence and the totals summed.

```js
ctx.scoped("chat:42").count({ kind: "fact" });        // this tenant's live facts
ctx.count({ scope: "chat:42" });                      // facts + episodes + docs for the tenant
```

`opts`: `scope` (tenant string or `GLOBAL`), `kind` ⊆ `{fact, episode, doc}` — single, array, or
omitted (→ all three: the tenant's whole writable memory). `code`/file rows are repo-global and out of
scope here (use `size` for the grand total). Under `strictScope` a missing `scope` **throws** for any
axis touched. Sync, cheap (a `SELECT count(*)`).

### `await ctx.enumerate(opts)` → `{ items: EnumItem[], total, offset, nextOffset }`
**Exhaustive, rank-free, paginated walk of one memory kind** — the structural opposite of `recall`.
`recall` is FTS-gated, ranked, and capped: it answers *"the most relevant N"* and **misses the tail by
design** (measured 0.05–0.24 recall on a *"how many of these are X"* ask — BM25 caps at lexical hits,
KNN at `K`, and no `n` makes it exhaustive). `enumerate` is the read for **count / "all of them"**
batch questions: no query, no score, no embedder — an ordered `rowid` table read that runs identically
with the embeddings tier on or off. **API-only, never model-callable** (like `stash`): a deterministic
orchestrator is the only caller — an LLM must never be able to say *"dump everything"*. The primary
consumer is bareagent's RLM `scan`.

```js
// walk every fact for a tenant, in stable insertion order, judging each — the only honest count
let off = 0, all = [];
do {
  const page = await ctx.scoped("chat:42").enumerate({ kind: "fact", offset: off, limit: 200, body: true });
  all.push(...page.items);                 // page.items: { path, kind, format, occurredAt, body? }
  off = page.nextOffset;                   // advances by items.length; null at the last page
} while (off !== null);
// unioning every page === EXACTLY the tenant's fact rows — gapless, no dupes
```

`opts`: `kind` — **`fact` | `episode` only** (v1 is the memory axis; a non-mem `kind` **throws**);
`scope` (tenant string or `GLOBAL`); `offset`/`limit` (page window, default `0`/`100` — validated
non-negative / positive integers); `body` (inline verbatim stored text, default off — same fidelity as
`recall({body:true})`, `=== get(id).text`). Returns `total` (the kind's **scoped** count, `=== count`),
the page `offset`, and `nextOffset` (`offset + items.length` while rows remain, else `null`).
**Scope-fenced on `mem_scope.owner`** via the **same** resolver `recall`/`count` use (own ∪ shared only;
`GLOBAL` → shared tier; `strictScope` → a missing `scope` **throws**), so it cannot leak another
tenant's rows. Order is `rowid` (insertion order) → **deterministic and stable**, so a consumer's
multi-pass union/shuffle over `offset` is gapless. Writes **nothing** to the recall audit log (a full
scan is batch tooling, not user demand). `code`/`doc` enumeration (a second expiry-aware `doc_scope`
path, file-granular) lands when a codebase-scan consumer exists. (`OFFSET` is O(n) in SQLite; fine for
the row counts targeted — a `rowid`-cursor is the deferred large-store path.)

### `ctx.size()` → `number`
Indexed document count (file-granularity).

### `ctx.close()` → `void`
Closes the SQLite connection. Call it when done (especially for file-backed DBs).

### `await compress(node, opts?)` → `Promise<string>`
The **rank-tiered render** primitive (R-C7) — a free function, not a `ctx` method (`import { compress } from "litectx"`).
Given a graph node and a `level`, return its text at one of three fidelities:
- `node`: `{ text, format?, symbol? }` — `text` is the symbol's source (a chunk body); `format`
  (`"js"|"ts"|"py"|…`) is needed for `signature`/`drop`; `symbol` improves the `drop` marker. To get
  `text` from a `recall` hit: take `hit.chunk.{startLine,endLine}` and slice `get(hit.path).text` to
  that 0-based inclusive range; `format` is `hit.format`. (`recall`/`nodesForPath` give the line range,
  not the text — slice the file body yourself.)
- `opts.level`: `"verbatim"` → the body unchanged · `"signature"` (default) → the declaration header
  **with its doc**, implementation body elided · `"drop"` → a `"name …"` marker.
- The **signature** tier is tree-sitter-extracted (cut at the def's `body` field), so it keeps
  `export`/`async`/decorators/generics/multiline params, prepends a JS/TS JSDoc, re-attaches a Python
  docstring, and wraps a bare **method** chunk so methods compress too. **~82% byte savings with the doc
  kept** on real code. Unparseable content (markdown, a preamble chunk, an unknown `format`) falls back
  **losslessly to verbatim**.
- A **pure view**: no DB, no ranking, no weights — it composes with `recall` (which ranks the nodes)
  but owns none of its logic. Library API only (a render mechanic the host loop runs, like `stash`/`peek`
  — not an MCP verb). `COMPRESS_LEVELS` exports the level vocabulary.

### `await assemble(units, ctx?)` → `Promise<{ units, dropped, tokens }>`
The **budget-fit** primitive (RT-1) — a free function (`import { assemble } from "litectx"`), the CE
read-path keystone. A host loop hands litectx a neutral **unit** array (its messages, grammar-stripped)
plus a token budget; litectx returns the fitted **view** for the next model call. litectx owns *content
+ relevance*, never the provider's transcript grammar — so `role` is opaque to it, and two flags carry
the contract:
- `unit`: `{ id, role, content, kind?, format?, symbol?, pinned?, atomic?, tokensApprox? }` — `pinned`
  units are never dropped or reordered (system prompt, current task); `atomic` units sharing a group id
  (a tool-call + its result) are kept-or-dropped **whole**, never split (broken grammar is unrepresentable,
  not caught). `tokensApprox` is the caller's estimate (falls back to `chars/4`). `format`/`symbol` on an
  injected `kind:"code"|"doc"` unit enable the COMPRESS tier (below).
- `ctx`: `{ budget?, task? }` — `budget` in tokens (omitted → keep all); `task` is reserved (the SELECT
  slice was POC-killed — see Scope) and unused by the fit.
- **Returns** `{ units, dropped, tokens }`: `units` is the kept view in **original order** (cache-stable —
  pinned in place, no reordering); a unit down-tiered by COMPRESS carries `compressed: true` and its
  `content` is the signature (full body recoverable by `id`, like a drop). `dropped` is `[{ id, reason }]`
  accounting for **every** elided unit (no silent loss — restorable by `id` from the host's canonical
  transcript); `tokens` is the view size (best-effort ≤ budget; pinned that alone exceed budget are still
  kept — never a hard cap).
- The fit is **recency-anchored** — the constraint the budget-fit POC pinned (`poc/assemble-fit-*.mjs`):
  re-reads are recency-bound, not topic-bound, so it keeps the newest un-pinned units and never reorders.
  Deterministic & cache-stable (no DB, no model, no clock); **async** because the COMPRESS tier awaits the
  tree-sitter render (a pure parse — still reproducible).
- **COMPRESS budget tier (shipped):** when the fit would **drop** a parseable `code`/`doc` unit, it is
  instead recovered as its `compress()` **signature** (header + doc, body elided) — rank/recency-driven
  (reuses the fit's order, *not* a positional rule), fires only when the signature both saves bytes and
  fits. Validated on real functions through this verb: signature retrieval **8/8** vs drop **0/8**, mean
  saving **81%** (`poc/assemble-compress-seam-poc.mjs`).
- **Scope:** ships **FIT + COMPRESS**. **SELECT** (recall-inject new graph context) is *not* here —
  auto-SELECT on in-window signal was POC-killed (`poc/assemble-select-poc.mjs`); fetch your own code with
  `recall`/`get`/`impact` and pass injected `code`/`doc` units in explicitly (COMPRESS then tiers them).
  Library API only (a host-loop mechanic, like `compress` — not an MCP verb).

### `await summaryWindow(units, ctx?)` → `Promise<{ units, dropped, tokens }>`
The **rolling-summary** read-path verb (R-C6) — a free function (`import { summaryWindow } from "litectx"`)
that composes `assemble`. Under budget pressure it keeps the **last-N** transcript turns verbatim and rolls
everything **older** into one rolling summary, then budget-fits via `assemble`. litectx owns the *policy*;
the **host owns the model** — litectx never calls one.
- `ctx`: the same as `assemble` plus — `summarize` (**required to engage**): a host-supplied
  `(messages: {role,content}[]) => Promise<string>`; `summaryKeep` = N recent turns kept verbatim (default
  8); `summaryRole` = role for the summary unit (default `"system"`; role is the consumer's grammar, so the
  host names it); `summaryId` = its id (default derived from the folded range).
- **Engages only under budget pressure.** No `summarize`, or everything already fits the budget, or fewer
  than 2 older turns to fold → it is a plain `assemble` (no model call, no summary). So it is **never worse
  than FIT**.
- **The summary unit** carries `summary: true` and `summarizes: [ids]` (the turns it folded) and is placed
  as the **freshest** content — a cache-stable dynamic suffix, so the verbatim prefix stays byte-identical
  for prefix caching. Each folded turn is reported in `dropped` with **`reason: "summarized"`** (restorable
  by `id`, like a drop). If even the summary can't fit, it is dropped like any unit (**never an overflow**),
  and its folded turns degrade to `reason: "budget"`.
- Excludes `pinned`/`atomic`/`code`/`doc` from folding (pinned never elides; tool-call pairs never become
  prose; code/doc are the COMPRESS tier's job inside `assemble`). Library API only.
- Validated end-to-end with a live model (`poc/rc6-summarywindow-poc.mjs`): at equal budget, summaryWindow
  retained the dropped-turn answers FIT-drop lost (**3/3 vs 0/3**). Integration with bareagent's real
  `summarize()` seam is pending its §23 build; the verb works today with any host-supplied summarizer.

### `await trim(units, policy?)` → `Promise<{ units, dropped, harvest }>`
The **transcript-truncation** verb (R-C5) — a free function (`import { trim } from "litectx"`). Where
`assemble` produces a non-destructive per-step **view** (your canonical transcript is preserved), `trim`'s
intent is **eviction**: drop old turns by a recency heuristic and hand back exactly what was dropped so you
can **harvest-before-evict** (persist, then discard). A **thin verb** — it never reimplements the fit math.
- `policy`: **`maxTokens`** (SIZE) — delegates wholesale to `assemble`'s recency-anchored fit (incl. the
  COMPRESS rescue tier); or **`keepLastN`** (COUNT) — keep the N most-recent un-pinned **items** (an
  `atomic` group counts as one item). `maxTokens` wins if both are given; neither set → no-op (keep all).
- Both policies preserve the invariants: **`pinned` never drops**, **`atomic` groups are kept/dropped
  whole** (an atomic group with any pinned member is force-kept).
- **The eviction contract:** `harvest` is the array of dropped units **with content intact** (same ids as
  `dropped`) — the worklist to persist *before* you remove those turns from your canonical transcript. A
  unit `assemble` down-tiered to a COMPRESS signature stays in `units` (still present) → never harvested.
- COUNT is genuinely distinct from a budget: no `maxTokens` reproduces "keep the last N turns" once turn
  sizes vary (`poc/rc5-trim-poc.mjs`, C2a). Library API only.
- Typical interlock: `const { units, harvest } = await trim(msgs, { keepLastN: 12 }); for (const u of
  harvest) await lc.remember(u.id, u.content, { kind: "episode" }); /* then drop the dropped ids */`.

### `liteCtxAsStore(lc, opts?)` → a host `Store`
Mount an indexed `LiteCtx` as a host's swappable memory backend — the four-method `Store` shape
(`{ store, search, get, delete }`) a runtime like bareagent's `Memory` expects — so a substring-scan
`JsonFileStore` can be swapped for litectx in **one line**, host code unchanged, gaining ranked,
graph-aware recall. A free function (`import { liteCtxAsStore } from "litectx"`); it **copies** the
host's shape, no import of the host.

```js
const memory = new Memory({ store: liteCtxAsStore(lc) });   // lc: a LiteCtx (its own dbPath = isolation)
const id = await memory.store("Auth uses JWT", { tag: "auth" });  // → minted id; ranked, not substring
const hits = await memory.search("how does auth work");           // [{ id, content, metadata, score }]
```

- **`store(content, metadata?)` → `Promise<id>`** — mints a namespaced id (`"<kind>:<uuid>"`) and
  `remember`s. `metadata.kind` (default `"fact"`) and `metadata.by` drive the write; **every other key
  rides the sealed `meta` passthrough** and round-trips verbatim. The adapter is the store, so *it* owns
  the id — the host never supplies one.
  - **Adapter writes are gated + audited.** Because `store()` calls `lc.remember()`, any `writeGate` /
    `writeAudit` wired on `lc` applies to writes made through the adapter too — the consumer (e.g.
    bareagent's `Memory`) stays transparent; you wire the gate/sink **once on `lc`**, not per consumer.
- **`search(query, options?)` → `Promise<[{ id, content, metadata, score }]>`** — ranked recall with
  `{ body: true }` (content inlined). Targets **one kind** (`options.kind`, default `"fact"`) so scores
  stay comparable; `options.limit` caps results. `metadata` comes back whole (kind/by reassembled +
  the passthrough).
- **`get(id)` → `{ id, content, metadata } | null`** · **`delete(id)`** → `forget(id)`.
- `opts.kind` sets the default write/search kind. `store`/`search` are **async** (litectx embeds /
  ranks); `get`/`delete` are sync. Give each sub-agent its **own `dbPath`** for isolation — separate
  files, zero shared state.

### Named exports (advanced / extension)
- `compress(node, { level })` / `COMPRESS_LEVELS` — the R-C7 render primitive above.
- `assemble(units, { budget, task })` — RT-1 budget-fit a neutral transcript to a token budget (the section above).
- `summaryWindow(units, { budget, summarize, summaryKeep, summaryRole, summaryId })` — R-C6 rolling-summary read-path over `assemble` (the section above).
- `trim(units, { maxTokens, keepLastN })` — R-C5 transcript-truncation: evict old turns + return the `harvest` worklist (the section above).
- `liteCtxAsStore(lc, { kind })` — mount litectx as a host `Store` (the section just above).
- `toWriteAction(id, text, { kind, provenance, meta, injectionRisk })` → the pure write-gate emitter
  (the `{ type: "memory.write", … }` action shape); `WriteAudit` → standalone JSONL audit sink (ships no
  secret patterns; takes a host `redact`); `WriteDeniedError` → thrown when a wired `writeGate` denies a
  write (carries `.id` + `.decision`). See the `writeGate` config + `remember` write-gate note above (§10.1).
- `observe(ctx)` → wrap a `LiteCtx` so every CE verb call is recorded into `ctx.trace` (the **contextgraph**
  pipeline view); `ctx.tap(verb, fn)` folds in free-function verbs; or just set `trace: true` on the config.
  `ContextGraph` → the recorder (`.json()` + agent-readable `.mermaid()`); `PRIMITIVES`/`VERBS_BY_PRIMITIVE`/
  `PRIMITIVE` → the Write/Select/Compress/Isolate verb taxonomy. Renders + full setup: `docs/03-usage/graphs.md`.
- `KINDS: string[]` — the canonical memory-kind vocabulary a bare `recall(query)` groups
  over: `["code", "doc", "fact", "episode"]`. `code`/`doc` enter via `index()` (files,
  routed by extension); `fact`/`episode`/`doc` via `remember()` (direct writes).
- `WRITE_KINDS: readonly string[]` — the write-side subset `remember()` accepts:
  `["fact", "episode", "doc"]` (`KINDS` minus `code`, which enters only via `index()`).
  `remember()` validates against this exact constant, so bind it (rather than re-typing the list)
  when gating a config before you write — it can't drift if the write set ever changes.
- `GLOBAL: symbol` — the shared-tier scope sentinel (the `strictScope` / `scoped()` opt-in for the
  doc axis). A read/write **sentinel, never stored** (maps to `doc_scope.scope IS NULL`); pass it as a
  `scope` or bind `ctx.scoped(GLOBAL)` to act on the global KB deliberately. See the scope note + `scoped()`.
- `ScopedView` — the class `ctx.scoped(scope)` returns (exposed for typing; construct via `scoped()`, not directly).
- `Store` — the SQLite/FTS5 store class (used internally by `LiteCtx`; exposed for
  tooling and tests). Notable read methods: `count()`, `nodeCount()`,
  `nodesForPath(path)` → `{ symbol, node_type, start_line, end_line }[]`.
- `splitIdent(s)` / `keywords(query)` / `ftsMatch(query)` — the code-aware
  tokenizer primitives (identifier splitting, keyword extraction, FTS5 MATCH
  building). Useful if you build queries by hand.

> `ctx.store` is reachable but is **not a stability promise** pre-1.0 — the
> `nodes` schema is the substrate for in-progress slices and may change. Treat
> `index` / `recall` / `size` / `close` as the stable surface.

## Consumption surfaces — CLI & MCP (slice 10)

The library is the core; two **thin adapters** ship in the same package, both wrapping the
public API above exactly as an external consumer would (nothing in the library knows they
exist — importing `litectx` as a lib loads zero surface code). Use whichever fits the caller;
mixing them over one `.litectx/index.db` is fine.

### `litectx` (CLI)

```
# embeddings (semantic recall) are ON by default; pass --no-embeddings for the BM25-only base
litectx index [root] [--force] [--no-embeddings]
litectx recall <query...> [--kind code|doc|fact|episode] [-n <n>] [--no-embeddings] [--no-log]
litectx get <id> [--no-log]                    # metadata → stderr, body → stdout (pipes clean)
litectx recent [--since <days>] [-n <n>]       # "what was I working on" — recent chunk-edits
litectx promotions [--threshold <n>]           # hot agent episodes to distil into facts (default 10)
litectx impact <symbol>
litectx remember <id> [text...] [--kind fact|episode|doc] [--by human|agent] [--no-embeddings]
litectx forget <id>            # or bulk: litectx forget --kind <k> / --by <b>
litectx help | --help | -h     # usage + the output-column legend (exit 0); also shown bare
```
All commands take `--root <dir>` (default: cwd). `remember` reads its body from the arguments
or, when absent, from piped stdin (`git log -1 --format=%s | litectx remember ep:release
--kind episode`). Exit 1: unknown id (`get`), nothing matched (`forget`), unknown symbol
(`impact`), and any bad invocation (prints usage to stderr); `help`/`--help`/`-h`/no command
print usage to stdout and exit 0. `--no-log` is the demand-signal opt-out (see Gotchas) — use
it for dashboards, CI, and batch scripts.

Output is **tab-separated** (composable with `awk`/`cut`; `help` prints this legend):
`recall` → `score  kind/format  path  → chunk-symbol:start-end  git:Ncommits/age(m|h|d)` (memory
hits append `provenance use:N`); `recent` → `age(m|h|d)  edits×  kind  path  › symbol`.

### `litectx-mcp` (MCP server)

A hand-rolled **stdio** MCP server — newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0, spawned and owned by the
MCP client, **not a daemon** (exits when the client hangs up; the no-service rule holds). Zero
dependencies beyond litectx itself. Client config:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "litectx": { "command": "litectx-mcp", "args": ["--root", "/path/to/repo"] } } }
```

The spawned instance runs the **semantic tier ON by default**; pass `--no-embeddings` for BM25-only. The tools are the public
operations: `index`, `recall`, `impact`, `get`, `recent`, `promotions`, `remember`, `forget` — recall
returns scored *pointers*, `get` fetches a body, `recent` lists witnessed chunk-edits, `promotions`
lists hot episodes to distil, same contract as the lib. Tool failures come back
in-band (`isError` results an agent can read and self-correct); protocol errors are reserved
for malformed JSON-RPC. **No `log: false` is exposed over MCP** — an MCP client is a live
agent, which is precisely the demand the audit log exists to capture; non-demand consumers
belong on the lib or the CLI's `--no-log`.

**Warm-on-boot.** An MCP-only host has no SessionStart hook to build the index, so right after
answering the `initialize` handshake the server kicks a **background** `ctx.index()` — fire-and-forget,
the handshake never waits on it, and a rejection is logged to stderr (never the JSON-RPC stdout stream).
A cold first build is one-time per repo; warm boots are a ~ms no-op. Set `LITECTX_NO_WARM_INDEX` to opt
out and manage indexing yourself.

**The surfaces expose the core options, not every lib option — deliberately.** Lib-only
(use `import { LiteCtx }` if you need them): pathspec-scoped indexing (`index({ paths })`),
multi-kind recall arrays (`kind: ["code", "doc"]`), `remember`'s `format` override and
`occurredAt` backdating (a surface writes an episode as happening *now* — backdating is an
ingestion concern), and the embeddings fusion knobs (`embedWeight`, `embedModel`,
`embedder`). Both surfaces stay thin adapters; anything beyond their flags/arguments is the
library's job, not a surface re-export.

## The `nodes` substrate (slice 2)

Indexing now also splits each file into **symbol/section chunks** with line
ranges, stored in a `nodes` table:

- **Code** (TS, JS, Python) → one chunk per function / method / class, plus a
  "preamble" chunk for top-level lines (imports, module constants/docstring).
  Parsing uses **tree-sitter** (vendored WebAssembly grammars). Over-counting
  (e.g. nested arrows) is acceptable by design — the eventual output is a risk
  *bucket*, not a precise reference list.
- **Markdown** → one chunk per heading section.
- **Anything else / parse failure** → a single file-level chunk (never throws).

These chunks are **additive**: recall still gates on the file-level FTS index, so
adding them does not change ranking yet. They exist to feed block-level git
signals, graph edges, and the impact view in later slices.

## Architecture

One SQLite file holds two FTS5 tables — `docs` (code + all docs, keyword-exact;
indexed files and direct-written docs share it, discriminated by a `source`
column) and `mem` (facts + episodes, porter-stemmed) — plus a `file_index` table
for incremental change detection, a `nodes` table for the symbol substrate,
`edges` (imports → spreading; impact), `git_sig` (activity metadata),
`file_embeddings` (the opt-in tier), `recall_log` (the slice-7 audit/access
log), and two **non-FTS sidecars** for written memory — `mem_text` (verbatim
text) and `mem_meta` (the sealed opaque-metadata passthrough, RT-3): both live
outside every FTS table by design, so they're returned but never searched. A `kind` routes to exactly one FTS table, and kinds never share a ranking,
so BM25 scores never merge across the two. Indexing is **routed by file
extension** (never by content) and
prefers `git ls-files` (tracked files, respects `.gitignore`), falling back to a
filesystem walk that skips the usual noise directories. The whole thing runs
synchronously against the file except parsing, which uses an async WASM runtime.

## What's NOT in litectx, and why

- **No LSP / language server — ever.** Edge resolution is `ripgrep -w` + tree-sitter
  queries only; accuracy comes from per-language config. litectx is near-perfect at
  *detecting* call/import syntax and deliberately *imprecise at resolving bindings* —
  it **over-counts by design** (PRD §7). **Where the imprecision is risk-free vs. where
  the safety contract bites:** in **recall** (shipped — import-spreading), an edge only
  nudges a rank, so over- *or* under-counting is harmless; recall makes no isolation
  claim and carries none of the risk. The contract applies to the **impact** view
  (roadmap), where "isolated → safe to change" *is* load-bearing: **over-counting
  connectivity is safe (errs cautious); under-counting is dangerous** (a false
  "isolated" breaks hidden consumers). So when impact lands, a high/connected result is
  a normal claim, but **"isolated / unused / low-risk" is only ever a hedged review
  candidate, never a guarantee** — and dead-code is "likely-unused, review," never
  "safe to delete." Precise import-vs-usage binding is a non-goal. Closed decision.
- **No embeddings by default.** The semantic tier ships (slice 6) but is the single
  **opt-in**, off by default: dual-hybrid (BM25 + spreading) ≈ 85% vs tri-hybrid ≈ 95%,
  and embeddings add cold-start model-load latency + an ML dependency not worth
  defaulting on. Turn it on with `embeddings: true` + `npm i @huggingface/transformers`.
- **No service / daemon / network / telemetry.** It runs in your process against a
  file on disk.
- **No alternative store.** SQLite + FTS5, single file. BM25 is native in SQL;
  vectors (embeddings tier) would live in the same file. Closed question.
- **No token-budget / guardrail / prompt-assembly concerns.** That is the
  caller's (harness) layer. litectx returns ranked results; what you do with them
  is policy.
- **No extraction LLM, no trust funnel, no consolidation.** `remember()` stores what you
  hand it — litectx never runs a model to distill docs into facts, decide what's worth
  remembering, merge near-duplicates, or run the human-review loop. It supplies the
  *mechanism* (write, recall, the `reviewCandidates` trigger, promote/forget actions);
  *what* becomes a fact and *which* facts get promoted is consumer policy. litectx is the
  low-write-bar retrieval store (write freely; only relevant items surface) — curating a
  high-bar "hot" always-injected memory on top of it is your layer.
- **No content sniffing.** Language is decided by extension only.

## Gotchas

- **`index()` and `recall()` are async; `size()`/`close()` are sync.** `await` index and
  recall; don't `await` size/close.
- **Recall is BM25 + spreading** (kind-scoped), plus **semantic cosine** when the embeddings
  tier is on. **recency** effects (base-level activation) remain the access-log tier and
  won't appear from git history alone — the POC showed git-seeded recency is repo-dependent,
  so git ships as grounding metadata, not ranking weight.
- **Same-mtime + same-size content swap.** Change detection fast-skips on
  `(mtime, size)`; an edit that lands within one filesystem mtime tick *and* keeps
  the exact byte length can be missed. Use `index({ force: true })` to be certain.
- **Scoped passes don't delete.** `index({ paths })` never removes files outside
  the given pathspecs — by design. A full `index()` reconciles deletions.
- **`git ls-files` is preferred.** In a git repo, only tracked files are indexed
  (untracked files need `git add` or a non-git fallback). Outside a git repo, a
  filesystem walk is used instead.
- **`.tsx` / `.jsx` are best-effort.** v1 grammars are TS, JS, Python; JSX-heavy
  files may fall back to a file-level chunk. They are not in the default `include`.
- **`recall()` and `get()` write — unless you opt out.** Since slice 7, every recall appends
  its hits to the `recall_log` audit table, and since slice 9 every `get` appends a fetch row
  (tagged `action: 'fetch'`, kept apart from recall's demand signal) — so by default both need
  a writable db, and the log grows with use (append-only; small rows, but unbounded — pruning
  policy is yours until the access-log tier defines one). Pass `{ log: false }` for read-only
  opens and for any consumer whose queries aren't real demand (dashboards, CI, batch tooling)
  — the log is a demand signal, and non-demand traffic pollutes it.
- **`get()` on a file reads disk, not the index.** The store keeps a processed *searchable
  surface*, not a copy of your files — so `get("src/auth.js").text` is the file as it is
  *now*, even if it changed since the last `index()` (and `null` if it was deleted; the
  next `index()` sweeps the row). Written memory (`fact`/`episode`/direct `doc`) is the
  exception: it has no file behind it, so its raw text is stored and returned verbatim.
- **Facts/episodes recall across word forms; docs and code stay keyword-exact — deliberately.**
  `fact`/`episode` recall is porter-stemmed: *"refund policy"* finds a fact stored as
  *"refunds are honored…"* (inflection — plurals, -ed/-ing — is covered; derivational shifts
  like "deployment"→"deploys" and compounds like "rollback"→"rolled back" are not). `doc` and
  `code` are **not** stemmed: in code, word-forms are distinct symbols (`token`/`tokens`/
  `tokenize`), and stemming measurably hurt code ranking — so an FAQ written via `remember`
  still needs exact words (or key terms repeated in its `id`, which is indexed). Pure
  paraphrase ("money back" → "refunds") matches nothing lexically for any kind. **With the
  embeddings tier on, `fact`/`episode` close that hole (slice 11 — KNN union):** cosine
  *nominates* up to 8 stored vectors nearest the query into the pool, so "money back" reaches
  the refunds fact with zero shared words (bench: para MRR 0.000 → 0.574, top-3 83%, with exact
  and morph held). Two honest limits: it needs the tier **on at write time** (a fact written with
  the tier off has no vector and never nominates — re-`remember` it to embed it), and an
  off-topic query may still surface weakly-similar facts ranked low (only zero/negative
  similarity is never nominated). `doc`/`code` remain strictly BM25-gated — there the tier only
  re-ranks the lexical pool, so with the tier **off** (the default), *write facts in the words
  you'll query* is still the rule.
- **`forget` only forgets written memory.** It cannot remove an indexed file (delete the
  file + re-`index()` for that), and `remember` cannot overwrite an indexed file's row —
  the two populations share the store but are write-isolated by design.
- **The embeddings tier loads a remote model file (optional dep only).** Turning it on pulls
  `@huggingface/transformers`, which fetches the default `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model once from
  the HuggingFace Hub on first use and parses an ONNX **model file** — so only load models from a
  source you trust. (The optional dep's transitive chain is `npm audit`-clean as of the
  `@huggingface/transformers` v4 migration; the older `@xenova/transformers` chain carried
  `protobufjs` advisories.) The deterministic BM25 core — the library default — pulls none of this
  and runs fully offline.
- **Upgrading over an old index db is safe — the store self-heals on open.** A db created
  by ≤ 0.1.0 (its `docs` table predates the write-path columns) is detected and rebuilt on
  the next open — it can only contain re-indexable files, never written memory, so nothing
  is lost; run `index()` once to repopulate. Newer column-additive deltas are applied with
  `ALTER`, preserving data. You never need to delete `.litectx/` by hand.
- **`close()` matters for file DBs.** The store uses WAL; close to flush cleanly.
- **`impact()` requires `ripgrep` (`rg`) on `PATH`.** The caller sweep shells out to
  `rg -w`; it is **not** bundled. If `rg` is missing the sweep returns nothing and
  `impact()` reports **0 callers** — i.e. a symbol can read as isolated purely because
  the tool is absent (a §7.2 false-isolation, the one dangerous error). Install
  ripgrep on any host (CI, container, dev box) that calls `impact()`. `recall()` and
  `index()` do **not** need it.

## Constraints

- **Runtime:** Node **≥ 18**, ESM only (`"type": "module"`). **`ripgrep` (`rg`) on
  `PATH`** is required for `impact()` (not for `recall`/`index`) — see Gotchas.
- **Dependencies (shipped):** `better-sqlite3` (native SQLite) and
  `web-tree-sitter` (WASM parser runtime, pinned). The 3 grammars (Python, JS, TS)
  are **vendored** in the package (~3.4 MB unpacked) — no extra grammar download.
- **Indexed languages (v1):** TS, JS, Python (code) + Markdown (docs). Adding a
  language is tree-sitter queries + edge config, not a core change.
- **One index = one SQLite file.** Rebuildable from source at any time.
